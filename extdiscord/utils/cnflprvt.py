Bot confliction preventer.

Because that ther are multiple bots used for this project, one of it is for the service, one of them is for testing,
if there are some tests is running, the fact that service bot will also process the message being sent is undesirable,
hence this preventer.

This preventer will be automatically activated by importing this in the code.
To disable, delete the usage in ``log_bot_presence`` and ``prioritized_bot_exists`` in ``extdiscord.core``.

Configure ``id_to_check`` to decide which bot to process the message.
